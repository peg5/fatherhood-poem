\begin{verse}[\versewidth]

My fate is that I am to be a father\\
And there is not an option to turn back\\
To other men, this fate would be a bother\\
Maturity and fortitude, they lack\\
Some folks believe they're living for a purpose\\
To save the world, or other random goals\\
But things like these aren't deeper than the surface\\
And their integrity is full of holes\\
I, on the other hand, have always wondered\\
Oh, what must I accomplish in this life?\\
For many years, I fumbled and I blundered\\
Until I found the answer with my wife\\
Six years, we took, to get to know each other\\
I had to do a lot of growing up\\
Throughout, I felt I did not have a druther\\
And all the time, half-empty was my cup\\
In time, I found the pot after the rainbow\\
Despite that it was present all the while\\
The light at tunnel's end was not a train, though\\
To understate the feeling is to smile\\
In short, we love each other more than ever\\
Together, we could thrive out in the wild\\
And will we separate and weaken? Never!\\
To set this all in stone, we made a child\\
And now my lengthy soul seeking has ended\\
I've figured out just why I do exist\\
To be a father's what the fates intended\\
And such a good one so that I'll be missed\\
And now, my empty cup is inundated\\
I wonder what my purpose is no more\\
Till life's conclusion, I will feel elated\\
I cannot wait for what I have in store\\
