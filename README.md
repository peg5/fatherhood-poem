# fatherhood-poem

What this is

This is not a piece of software. This is an original, currently untitled poem about my upcoming fatherhood.

What is it doing here

git is a great tool for tracking changes to software, so I thought, "Hmm, it would be really useful for writers as well because works of writing go through several drafts and revisions."

If you would like to revise suggest revisions, feel free to do so, but please use the "revision" branch.
