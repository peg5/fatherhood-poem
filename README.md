# fatherhood-poem

An untitled poem in progress that is about my upcoming fatherhood.
# What this is

This is not a piece of software. This is a work of poetry.

# What is it doing here

git is a great tool for tracking changes to software, so I thought, "Hmm, it would be really useful for writers as well because works of writing go through several drafts and revisions." I also intend for my writing to be a massivley collaborative effort, and git also condones such an endeavour.

If you would like to suggest revisions, feel free to do so. Please use the "revision" branch.
